# py-bca-skein
Python hashing function for the Skein blockchain algorithm

# Source
The source code was obtained from the coinhash github repo, but the original,
according to coinhash, originates from
https://github.com/birdonwheels5/p2pool-dgbSkein . I created this repo as 
something within my own control for availability.

The skein source code is original from the RNRT SAPHIR project.

The skeinmodule does not contain any license information, and I don't know who
wrote it originaly. The hashcoin repo does however give a GPL-3 license, for
which I assume, this file.

# Python versions
This package should be usable with Python2.7 and Python3.x.
